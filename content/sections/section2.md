## About this manual

The code for this manual is available [here](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_manual).

It runs online via emscripten, but can run as well on desktop and mobile platforms (via [hello_imgui](https://github.com/pthom/hello_imgui))

See also a related [demo for Implot](https://traineq.org/implot_demo/src/implot_demo.html), which also provides code navigation.
